<h2>Robotic team</h2>
<p>The Lo-Ellen Robotics team composes an extremely diverse group. Students from grades 9 to 12 interested in a variety of subjects from applied mechanical engineering to theoretical mathematics have come together to realize their goal. The inclusive social environment is ideal for fostering long-term friendships on top of new technological skills. As the team is very new, its focus will be the successful introduction into the school and community culture. Through the creation of a working robot, the team will compete in Robotics Contests, the first to be the Waterloo Regional in March of 2013. As well as competing, the team will introduce the experience to the community.</p>
